            <p>The book club of SSC is one of the legendary clubs established years ago.
                It has been a continuously growing community where both book worms
                and people with no culture of reading are served. Our vision is to create a 
                productive and essential book reading habit for our members.
                </p>
                <p>  Reading books and reviewing them is not the only thing we do. We’ve 
                    prepared many fun events, games and competitions as well as relevant
                    experience sharing sessions. Some of the books we’ve read include;
                   <Span class="colored-txt">Turtles all the way down, Instructions for dancing, Convenience store 
                    woman and many more to come.  </Span>
                   <br> Join us throughout the amazing journey we’ll have this year!</p>
